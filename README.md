Toy Drone App

The Toy Drone App is a simple web-based application that allows you to control a virtual toy drone on a grid. You can issue commands to the drone, such as moving it, rotating it, and even simulating attacks. This project serves as a fun way to practice basic programming concepts and user interface design.

Features

    Grid Interface: The app provides a grid-based interface where the drone's movements and actions are displayed.

    Command Input: You can enter commands through a text input field. Supported commands include PLACE, MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT, REPORT, and ATTACK.

    Real-time Updates: The app updates the grid in real-time to show the drone's position and any changes caused by commands.

Getting Started

    Clone this repository to your local machine.

    git clone https://github.com/Faith-ZAR/toy_drone.git

    Open the index.html file in your web browser to start the Toy Drone App.

    Enter commands in the text input field and click the "Execute" button to control the drone.

    Use the "Reset" button to clear the grid and start over.

Usage

    PLACE Command: To place the drone on the grid, enter a PLACE command followed by coordinates (e.g., PLACE 0,0,NORTH). 

    MOVE Command: Use the MOVE command to make the drone move one step in the current direction.

    LEFT and RIGHT Commands: Rotate the drone 90 degrees to the left or right using the LEFT and RIGHT commands, respectively.

    REPORT Command: Get the current position and direction of the drone by entering the REPORT command.

    ATTACK Command: Simulate an attack by entering the ATTACK command, which will place an "X" on the grid.

Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the Toy Drone App by modifying the styles.css file and adjusting the JavaScript code in script.js.
